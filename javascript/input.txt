The pipeTo() method of the ReadableStream interface pipes the current ReadableStream to a given WritableStream and returns a Promise that fulfills when the piping process completes successfully, or rejects if any errors were encountered.

Piping a stream will generally lock it for the duration of the pipe, preventing other readers from locking it.
